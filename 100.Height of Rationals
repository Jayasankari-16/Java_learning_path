/* In a recent breakthrough in mathematics, the proof utilized a concept called Height.
Consider a fraction a/b. 
Its Height is defined as the maximum of its numerator and denominator. 
So, for example, the Height of 3/19 would be 19, and the Height of 27/4 would be 27.
Given a and b, find the Height of a/b.
