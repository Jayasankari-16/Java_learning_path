/*Chef is looking to buy a TV and has shortlisted two models.
The first one costs A rupees, while the second one costs B rupees.
Since there is a huge sale coming up on Chefzon, Chef can get a flat discount of C rupees on the first TV, and a flat discount of D rupees on the second one.
Help Chef determine which of the two TVs would be cheaper to buy during the sale.*/
